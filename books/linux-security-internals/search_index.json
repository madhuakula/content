He sent out an email to a mailing list saying, “Hello everybody out there using minix — I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu) for 386 (486) AT clones.”\n\nFunctions of the Kernel:\n\nManages the hardware\nInstructs the CPU\nBridges hardware and running processes\nProcess and Memory management\nDevice Drivers\nSystem Calls and more.\n\n"},"linuxarch/processmanage.html":{"url":"linuxarch/processmanage.html","title":"Process Management","keywords":"","body":"Process\n\nAll processes start as user mode.

Virtualbox loads the Virtual Machine's Kernel into Ring 1.\nKernel Mode vs User Mode Execution\n\nIn Kernel mode, the executing code has complete and unrestricted access to the underlying hardware. It can execute any CPU instruction and reference any memory address. In User mode, the executing code has no ability to directly access hardware or reference memory. Code running in user mode must delegate to system APIs to access hardware or memory.\n\nThese two modes aren't mere labels; they're enforced by the CPU hardware. If code executing in User mode attempts to do something outside its purview-- like, say, accessing a privileged CPU instruction or modifying memory that it has no access to -- a trappable exception is thrown. Instead of your entire system crashing, only that particular application crashes. That's the value of User mode.\n"},"linuxarch/syscalls.html":{"url":"linuxarch/syscalls.html","title":"System Calls","keywords":"","body":"System Calls\n\nIn computing, a system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling. System calls provide an essential interface between a process and the operating system.\n\nBasically system calls allow the Ring 3 processes to do privileged operations. System calls send a software interrupt to the CPU and the Kernel performs the operations required. \nInterrupts\n\nIn system programming, an interrupt is a signal to the processor emitted by hardware or software indicating an event that needs immediate attention. An interrupt alerts the processor to a high-priority condition requiring the interruption of the current code the processor is executing.\n\nInterrupts allow an immediate request to be processed when the CPU is busy with something else.\nSteps\n\nUser process needs to perform a privileged action, so initiates an interrupt to the CPU.\nThe interrupt puts the CPU in Ring 0 and passes control to Kernel.\nThe kernel determines if the user process should be granted the system call (based on privileges).\nIf granted, the kernel will execute the system call\nOnce finished, the kernel initiates the change to Ring 3.\n\n"},"linuxarch/memorymanage.html":{"url":"linuxarch/memorymanage.html","title":"Memory Management","keywords":"","body":"Linux memory Management\n\nKernel keeps track of all RAM and how it's shared between processes. \nThe kernel splits the RAM into pages and maintains the state information about these subdivisions at all time.\nKernel effectively sandboxes memory of various processes\nShared memory is taken from free memory\nPaging is also handled by kernel\n\nKernel Space vs User Space\n\nKernel space is strictly reserved for running a privileged operating system kernel, kernel extensions, and most device drivers.

All of this happens transparently to the callers. The primary advantage is that if a caller never makes any modifications, no private copy need ever be created.\n\nPOC\nhttps://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io/wiki/PoCs\nDEMO\n"},"linux-containers.html":{"url":"linux-containers.html","title":"Linux Containers","keywords":"","body":"What are Linux Contianers?\n\nBefore moving on, let’s understand the difference between the containers and the virtual machine. \n\n\nhttp://patg.net/containers,virtualization,docker/2014/06/05/docker-intro/\nLinux containers, in short, contain applications in a way that keep them isolated from the host system that they run on. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. And they are designed to make it easier to provide a consistent experience as developers and system administrators move code from development environments into production in a fast and replicable way.\nNote: This is achieved through a combination of kernel security features such as namespaces, mandatory access control and control groups.\nVirtual Machines vs Containers\n\n\n\nVirtual Machines\nContainers\n\n\n\n\nIncludes the application, the necessary binaries and libraries, and an entire guest operating system\nInclude the application and all of its dependencies, but share the kernel with other containers, running as isolated processes in user space on the host operating system.\n\n\nTied to platform (virtualization software)\nWorks everywhere (Computer, Cloud, etc.)\n\n\nSize in GB’s\nSize in MB’s\n\n\nTakes minutes to start\nTakes seconds to start\n\n\nCostly\nCheaper\n\n\n\nWhat is Docker?\nDocker is an application that enables build, ship and run your code anywhere. Docker containers wraps your code, runtime, system tools and libraries and creates an image which can be distributed to the others and it guarantees that it will always run regardless of the environment. Docker is originally used LXC (LinuX container) technology, but later switched to runC (known as libcontainer). It uses resource isolation feature of the linux kernel to create a container such as name space, layered filesystem, network space and cgroups, etc.\nLearn more about docker here https://training.docker.com/category/self-paced-online\nOverview\n\nScenario Demo\n\nHow long does it take to setup an wordpress site for you?\n\n$ docker run --name mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=wordpress -d mysql\n\n$ docker run --name some-wordpress --link mysql:mysql -p 8080:80 -d wordpress\nSuper cool demo with HTOP\n\nRunning htop command in container and assigning host processes (example of giving privileges to containers)\n\n$ docker run --rm -it --pid host jess/htop\n"},"namespaces.html":{"url":"namespaces.html","title":"Namespaces","keywords":"","body":"What are the Linux Namespaces?\n\nThe kernel provides process isolation by creating separate namespaces for containers. Namespaces enable creating an abstraction of a particular global system resource and make it appear as a separated instance to processes within a namespace. Consequently, several containers can use the same resource simultaneously without creating a conflict.\n\nSome of the namespaces in Linux\n\nMount namespaces\nUTS namespaces (UNIX Timesharing System)\nIPC namespaces (Interprocess Communication)\nPID namespaces (Process Identification)\nNetwork namespaces\n\nNote: Namespaces are a feature of the Linux kernel that isolates and virtualizes system resources of a collection of processes. (wikipedia)\n\nThere is another type of namespace called user namespace. User namespaces are similar to PID namespaces, they allow you to specify a range of host UIDs dedicated to the container. Consequently, a process can have full root privileges for operations inside the container, and at the same time be unprivileged for operations outside the container.\n\nSample overview demo\n$ docker run -d alpine sleep 1000\n$ sudo ls /proc/[pid]/ns/\n"},"linux-namespaces.html":{"url":"linux-namespaces.html","title":"What are the Linux namespaces?","keywords":"","body":"What are the Linux name spaces?\nPID namespace\n PID namespaces isolate the process ID number space, meaning that processes in different PID namespaces can have the same PID.  PID namespaces allow containers to provide functionality such as suspending/resuming the set of processes in the container and migrating the container to a new host while the processes inside the container maintain the same PIDs.\nFor example, while running nginx docker container inside container we always see nginx PID 1 but outside host we see different PID like 9989\n$ docker run --name=samplewebapp1 -d nginx:alpine\n$ ps auxxx | grep nginx\n$ docker exec -it samplewebapp1 sh\n# top\n\n$ docker run --name=samplewebapp2 -d nginx:alpine\n$ ps auxxx | grep nginx\n$ docker exec -it samplewebapp2 sh\n# top\nMount namespace\n\nMount namespaces provide isolation of the list of mount points seen by the processes in each namespace instance.  Thus, the processes in each of the mount namespace instances will see distinct single-directory hierarchies.\n\nFor example, in docker we use -v option to volume mount the directories from host system to container.\n$ docker run --name=sampleapp1 -d alpine sleep 1000\n$ sudo cat /proc/[PID]/mountstats\n$ docker exec -it sampleapp1 sh\n# ls /data/\n\n$ mkdir testmount\n$ touch testmount/samplefile.txt\n$ docker run --name=sampleapp2 -d -v testmount:/data alpine sleep 1000\n$ sudo cat /proc/[PID]/mountstats\n$ docker exec -it sampleapp2 sh\n# ls /data/\nUTS namespace\nUTS namespaces provide isolation of two system identifiers: the hostname and the NIS domain name.\nFor example, we can see these by running the below commands\n$ hostname\n\n$ uname\n\n\n$ docker run -it alpine sh\n# hostname\n\n# uname\nNetwork namespace\nNetwork namespace provide isolation of network controllers, system resources associated with networking, firewall and routing tables. This allows container to use separate virtual network stack, loopback device and process space. You can add virtual or real devices to the container, assign them their own IP Addresses and even full iptables rules. \nFor example, we can view the different network settings by executing the ip addr command on the host and inside the container.\n$ ip addr\n\n$ docker run --name=samplenetapp -d alpine sleep 1000\n$ ps auxxx | grep sleep\n$ sudo ls /proc/[pid]/net/\n$ docker exec -it samplenetapp sh\n# ip addr\nIPC namespace\nEach IPC namespace has its own set of System V IPC identifiers and its own POSIX message queue filesystem.  Objects created in an IPC namespace are visible to all other processes that are members of that namespace, but are not visible to processes in other IPC namespaces.\nFor example, check the /proc/sysvipc in system to see the (sem, shm, msg)\nUser namespace\nUser namespaces isolate security-related identifiers and attributes, in particular, user IDs and group IDs, the root directory, keys, and capabilities.\nIn particular, a process can have a normal unprivileged user ID outside a user namespace while at the same time having a user ID of 0 inside the namespace; in other words, the process has full privileges for operations inside the user namespace, but is unprivileged for operations outside the namespace.\n"},"seccomp-bpf.html":{"url":"seccomp-bpf.html","title":"Seccomp","keywords":"","body":"Seccomp\nSeccomp stands for secure computing mode.

When enabling seccomp, the process enters a \"secure mode\" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible.\nSeccomp-bpf\nSeccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions.\nHow to call Seccomp-bpf?\n #include \n #include \n [...]\n prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_FILTER, &bpf_prog)\n"},"cgroups.html":{"url":"cgroups.html","title":"Control Group","keywords":"","body":"What are Cgroups\nThe kernel uses cgroups to group processes for the purpose of system resource management.

Processes (like web servers) that just need to bind on a port below 1024 do not have to run as root: they can just be granted the net_bind_service capability instead. And there are many other capabilities, for almost all the specific areas where root privileges are usually needed.\n\nStarting with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, known as capabilities, which can be independently enabled and disabled.\nFor exmaple, if you run a container that run ntpd, which needs to modify the host system time. The container would not run because it requires SYS_TIME. \nScenario Demo\nIf you specify the --privileged=true option to docker create or docker run, the container has access to all the devices on the host, which can present a security risk. For more precise control, you can use the --cap-add and --cap-drop options\n$ docker run -it alpine sh\n# ip route\n# ip route del default\n\n$ docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN -it alpine sh\n# ip route\n# ip route del default\n"},"lsm.html":{"url":"lsm.html","title":"Linux Security Modules","keywords":"","body":"What is LSM?\nThe Linux Security Module (LSM) framework provides a mechanism for\nvarious security checks to be hooked by new kernel extensions.\nThe primary users of the LSM interface are Mandatory Access Control\n(MAC) extensions which provide a comprehensive security policy.
