to \"Attacking & Auditing Docker Containers Using Open Source\" workshop.\nThis attack-focused, hands-on training will set you on the path to using common attack techniques against docker, containerized infrastructure and refine your approach when it comes to extending your attack to other resources of your target.\nAbstract\nDevelopers and Operations teams (DevOps) have moved towards containers and modern technologies. Attackers are catching up with these technologies and finding security flaws in them. In this workshop, we will look at how we can test for security issues and vulnerabilities in Dockerised environments . Throughout the workshop we will learn how we can find security misconfigurations, insecure defaults and container escape techniques to gain access to host operating system (or) clusters. In the workshop, we will look at real world scenarios where attackers compromised containers to gain the access to applications, data and other assets.\nBy the end of workshop participants will be able to\n\nUnderstand Docker security architecture\nAudit containerised environments\nPerform container escapes to get access to host environments\n\nPrerequisites\n\nA laptop with administrator privileges\n10 GB of free Hard Disk Space\nIdeally 8 GB of RAM but minimum 4 GB\nLaptop should support hardware-based virtualization\nIf your laptop can run a 64-bit virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox it should work\nOther virtualisation software might work but we will not be able to provide support for that\n\n\n\nStudent Prerequisites\n\nBasic understanding of Linux\nBasic understanding of Docker\n\nTake Aways\n\nA Gitbook(pdf, epub, mobi) with complete workshop content\nVirtual machines to learn & practice\nOther references to learn more about topics covered in the workshop\n\n"},"about-us/about-madhu.html":{"url":"about-us/about-madhu.html","title":"About - Madhu Akula","keywords":"","body":"Madhu Akula\nMadhu is a security ninja, security and devops researcher with extensive experience in the industry ranging from client facing assignments building scalable and secure infrastructure, to publishing industry leading research to running training sessions for companies and governments alike.\nMadhu's research papers are frequently selected for major security industry conferences including Defcon (26, 24), Blackhat 2018, Appsec EU 2018, All Day DevOps (2016, 2017), DevSecCon (London, Singapore, Boston), DevOpsDays India, c0c0n, Serverless Summit, ToorCon, DefCamp, SkydogCon, NolaCon and null, etc. Madhu was a keynote speaker for the National Cyber Security conference at Dayananda Sagar College in Feb 2016.\nWhen he’s not working with Appsecco’s clients or speaking at events he’s actively involved in researching vulnerabilities in open source products/platforms such as WordPress, Ntop, Opendocman etc. and is also a contributing bug hunter with Code Vigilant (a project to Secure Open Source Software). His research has identified many vulnerabilities in over 200 organisations including US Department of Homeland Security, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Adobe, LinkedIn, Ebay, At&t, Blackberry, Cisco, Barracuda etc. He is also an active member with Bugcrowd, Hackerone, Synack etc.\nMadhu has trained over 5000 people in information security for companies and organisations including the Indian Navy and the Ministry of e-services in a leading Gulf state. He is co-author of Security Automation with Ansible2 book published by Packt Publishing in December 2017, which is listed as a resource by the RedHat Ansible itself.\nSome of the trainings/workshops by Madhu Akula include\n\nAttacking & Auditing Docker Containers Using Open Source – Defcon 26\nBuilding visualisation platforms for OSINT data using open source solutions – Recon Village 2018\nAutomated Defense using Cloud Services for AWS, Azure and GCP – Blackhat USA 2018\nAutomated Defense using Serverless for AWS, Azure and GCP – Appsec EU 2018\nBreaking and Owning Cloud Servers and Applications - NULLCON Goa 2018\nNinja Level Infrastructure Monitoring – Defcon 24 and DevSecon London 2016\nAutomated Infrastructure Security Monitoring & Defence – DevSecCon Singapore 2017\nReal World Security Monitoring & Automated Defence for almost free – DevSecCon Boston and DevSeCon London 2017\nMonitoring & Defending Infrastructure Security Attacks - c0c0n X\nLinux Container Security – Null Bangalore\nAn Introduction to Containers using Docker and using it for Security Automation - Null Bangalore\nAutomating Documentation, Presentation, KB using Markdown – Null Bangalore\nAutomated infrastructure security monitoring & defence – Null Bangalore\n\nSome of the talks given by Madhu Akula include\n\nModern Security Operations aka Secure DevOps - All Day DevOps 2017\nAutomated Defence for Cloud Security in AWS using Serverless - Serverless Summit 2017\nDevOps principles to build your lean startup - Startup Leadership Program\nDevelopers guide to security & operations: Introducing DevSecOps - Software Security Bangalore Meetup\nAutomated Infrastructure Security Monitoring using FOSS – All Day DevOps 2016\nInfrastructure Security Monitoring – DevOps Days India 2016\nCloud Security for everyone – SDN + IoT + Network Virtualization Enthusiasts Meetup\nNodeJS Security – Null Bangalore\nWeb & Cloud Security in the Real World – Keynote speaker at CompTIA Bangalore\nMy bug hunting with open source – Hill hacks 2015\nHardening routers & switches – Null Dharamshala\nBasics of networking - Null Dharamshala\n\nPublished Works of Madhu Akula include\n\n\n\nCover\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\nBook – Security Automation with Ansible2, Published by PacktPub December 2017, ISBN 9781788394512\n\n\n\nOnline\n\n\n\nAccount\nDetails\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n@madhuakula\n\n\nLinkedIn\nMadhu Akula\n\n\n\n"},"intro/disclaimer.html":{"url":"intro/disclaimer.html","title":"Disclaimer","keywords":"","body":"Disclaimer\n\nThe attacks covered in the training are for educational purposes only.
